the write is a system call not a function, it takes 3 arguments
1- fd: file descriptor, is an integer that points to a file in a table of file descriptors
     - since everything in linux or unix system is a file
     - (0) is /dev/stdin
     - (1) is /dev/stdout
     - (2) is /dev/stderr
     so if we use write(1, ..., ...) we gonna print on the stdout which is the normal case
     or write(2, ..., ...) obviously we gonna print in the stderr and so on...
     - those three (read, write, error) are standard in unix and unix-like systems
     - if you use a value greater then 2 usually it's a manually opened file.
     - in the 42 Network pool you will only need the stdout (1)
2- buffer: takes the address of the beginning of a buffer in the memory
3- number of bytes to print from that address
